            By purchasing a book from the Upschool Library, you are able to direct a portion of sale proceeds to support
            an important charity project. Each book’s author has recommended a project they’d like you to support, but
            you can choose to support a different project. The total amount your purchase will raise for the charity
            project is shown when adding each book to the Cart, and at Check Out. If you wish to donate extra money to a
            charity project, you can do so at Check Out. You are also able to donate money to Upschool, to keep our
            courses free and to support our work, but this is optional. The more books purchased, greater the impact you
            can have in the world!
